# Flexible Calculator
## Calculator for quick calculation of complex mathematical expressions
  * This calculator is made according to the principle of standard calculation 
    in mathematics, when mathematical expressions of the type "2e&pi;(3 + 2)" and similar 
    are entered into the workbook, when it is assumed that the sign of the product is 
    between corresponding values, so the given expression is directly calculated 
    as "2 * e * &pi; * (3+2)".
  * Also, the number of possible errors when entering numbers or operators is maximally 
    reduced (eg if we first press the zero key and then press the zero key again, instead of 
    the inappropriate number in the decimal system "00" we get "0.") and similar .
